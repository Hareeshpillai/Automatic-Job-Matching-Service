Automatic Job Matching Service

Problem/Opportunity
Workers are feeling discouraged or unfulfilled at their current jobs but are unable to find work elsewhere due to the complicated process of finding a job. People might not have the resources, time, or self-motivation to search for new opportunities so instead they remain within that role but become less satisfied with their work, which then reflects poorly onto the company he or she works for. Furthermore, companies are unable to find workers that best fit the positions they need to fill since they are solely relying on the individual’s motivation to apply. 

Solution
Build a platform wherein workers and companies are able to simultaneously find a job opportunity that best fits their interest, experience, and education. This platform uses keywords from the employees’ profiles and resumes as well as the job listing information from companies to provide a match of a possible job. If the user shows further interest in the jobs returned from our system, he or she can send a resume to the company through our platform to begin the application process.

Objectives
1. Find workers jobs in which they will feel satisfied and motivated.
2. Connect companies to a more precise selection of job applicants.
3. Provide the opportunity for workers to work abroad if desired.

Assumptions
The majority of workers are unsatisfied in their current professions and want to find opportunities that best suite their goals and level of success.

Risk
Low user rate that does not provide a full range of services for both the workers and companies. 

Obstacle
The main obstacle in designing this system is to data mine for the user’s information in a secure and noninvasive way.
